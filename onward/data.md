On Data
-------

Prelude:
The popularization of the term "big data" has lead to a decadence of its meaning. The plain conception of big data is ill-conceied and often mis-directed. The present misconceptions are similar to the development of the term "the cloud." We had time-sharing decades ago, nowadays we refer to phenomenon of a remote virtual host as "the cloud."

Thesis:
There are three realizations which form the basis of elos' policy on data.

 1. Present technology allows us unprecendented instrumentation and data collection, we can accumulate information about our actions and habits: we can collect unconsciously.
 2. Raw data clears misconception and dissolves bias. The data we collect is *actionable* and should be treated as such.
 3. We can design systematic ways to act on the copious collection of information. The constraints we apply can be simple and remove the burden of indivudually processing each datum.

Manifestations:
The first thesis can be seen in the recent craze about privacy concerns and the ethicacy of collecting data on internet and computer users as consumers. People realized google can know everything about a user's search history. This epiphany was thrusted upon them in the form of accurately targeted ads, spooky in their relevance. This targeting led society to realize the data is not only correct and meaningful, but more importantly, the data is actionable.

Society bore witness to the effects of using this data, but what it has yet to realize, is that companies like google do not have people individually peering over tables of search terms, only to select specific ads. Rather they have systematic ways to apply the correct advertisements to individuals based on computer analysis of search history. Google's greatest source of revenue is their ad engine.

The next realization of society will be that this data is highly personal. Yes google has data on everybody and serves ads accurately for everbody but that is because they have specific data for each individual. People will realize they can collect data on their life and make informed decisions about it. Then they realize that the word "big" was inserted in our aforementioned buzzword with reason, that the instrumentation of our daily lives will lead to data overload, to a lot of information, which would be hard to process. Therefore we will use a system of frameworks programmed to react to this information in order to generate meaningful decision-based suggestions about our time.

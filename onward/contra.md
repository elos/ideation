On Contrarianism
----------------

To be contrarian is not merely to oppose what is popular, but rather to think independently. For setting oneself a contra to to the mainstream is to, fundamentally, still to define one's mode of thinking in term of popularly held beliefs. Much better to think and decide on your own, than to cleave to dissonance.

Elos is concerned with propelling community forward. Though ignorant of exactly what this progress be, we believe that the individual should be asked what she or he thinks of her or his path regularly. We strive to build this reflective component into our projects because we believe it is a defining factor of humanity. We belive it constitutes intellgince, the ability to reflect, the ability to step out and observe, even for a moment, the world around us.

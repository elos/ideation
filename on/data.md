On Data
-------

##### Prelude:
The popularization of the term "big data" has led to a decadence of its meaning. The plain conception of big data is ill-conceived and often misdirected. It reminds me of how we had time-sharing decades ago, but now refer to a remote virtual host as "the cloud."

##### Thesis:
There are three realizations which form the basis of elos' policy on data.

 1. Present technology allows instrumentation and data collection, the ability to accumulate information about our actions and habits. Especially important is that we can do so unconsciously.
 2. Raw data dissolves misconceptions and clears biases. The data is *actionable*.
 3. We can design systematic ways to act on the copious collection of information. The constraints we apply can be simple and remove the burden of individually, personally processing each datum.

##### Manifestations:
The first thesis appears in the recent craze about privacy concerns and the ethicacy of collecting data on users as consumers. People realized google can know everything about a user's search history. Google thrust this epiphany  upon the public in the form of accurately targeted ads - spookily relevant. This ad targeting taught society that data is not only correct, meaningful and insightful, but most importantly, _actionable_.

Society continues to witness the effects of companies acting on data, but it has yet to fully realize that these companies have no one peering over tables of search terms and hand-selecting specific ads. Rather they have systematic, programmatic means to apply the correct advertisements to individuals based on computer analysis of search history. And these algorithms prove successful: Google's greatest source of revenue is their ad engine.

We predict society will internalize that the collected data is highly personal: Google serves ads accurately for everyone, but that is because they have specific information and analysis on each _individual_. Elos is predicated on the realization that everyone can collect data about their life, and that this data can inform decisions. 

The future will realize that we added the "big" notation because the instrumentation of our daily lives will lead to data overload, to a lot of information. So much information that it would be unfeasible for a human to process. We need a system of frameworks programmed to react to this information and generate meaningful insights. Ultimately, this analysis will be decision-based, actionable, suggestions. This is elos.

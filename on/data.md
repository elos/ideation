On Data
-------

##### Prelude:
The popularization of the term "big data" has lead to a decadence of its meaning. The plain conception of big data is ill-conceived and often misdirected. It reminds me of how we had time-sharing decades ago, but now refer to a remote virtual host as "the cloud."

##### Thesis:
There are three realizations which form the basis of elos' policy on data.

 1. Present technology allows instrumentation and data collection, the ability to accumulate information about our actions and habits. Especially important is that we can do so unconsciously.
 2. Raw data dissolves misconceptions and clears biases. The data is *actionable*.
 3. We can design systematic ways to act on the copious collection of information. The constraints we apply can be simple and remove the burden of indivudually - personally - processing each datum.

##### Manifestations:
The first thesis appears in the recent craze about privacy concerns and the ethicacy of collecting data on users as consumers. People realized google can know everything about a user's search history. This epiphany thrust upon them in the form of accurately targeted ads - spookily relevant. This ad targeting taught society that data is not only correct and meaningful, but more importantly, actionable.

Society witnesses the effects of acting on data, but it has yet to realize that companies do not have people individually peering over tables of search terms and hand-selecting specific ads. Rather they have systematic ways to apply the correct advertisements to individuals based on computer analysis of search history. And these algorithms are succesfuly: Google's greatest source of revenue is their ad engine.

We predict society's will internalize that this data is highly personal: Google serves ads accurately for everyone, but that is because they have specific information and analysis on each individual. People will realize they can collect data on their own life, and then, that they can make informed decisions. 

Society will realize that the word "big" was a component of our buzzword for a reason: the instrumentation of our daily lives will lead to data overload, to a lot of information. So much information that it would be hard to process. They will realize that we need a system of frameworks programmed to react to this information and generate meaningful insights. Ultimately, this analysis will be decision-based, actionable, suggestions. This is elos.

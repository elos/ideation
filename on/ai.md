On Machine-Based Decision Making (psuedo-AI)
--------------------------------------------

##### Prelude:
Unsurprisingly, people often express discomfort at the idea of a computer system managing, and “deciding,” for them. They shy from the idea that a system, a perpetuator of misaligned, hyperbolized, perspectivistic values and goals, could ever accurately inform a meaningful human decision.

And rightly so: their uneasiness is not unfounded. For if we built a system without the human component, without the space for human expression, without the scope of human influence, we should destroy it.

##### Thesis:
With elos, we hope to design for the human component, to build in the possibility and opportunity and desire to step outside of the system. To ask our human users about their beliefs and values and goals - both distant and pressing.

We aspire to build a system that begs not the question of whether we like where we are, but instead raises the question of whether we like where humanity is going. We believe that such a point could nowhere else be better contested than in the individual’s life.

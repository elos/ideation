#### On Change

##### From the Elos Mission:
    "Progress, far from consisting in change, depends on retentiveness."

##### From the Elos Manifesto:
    "To improve the human condition is to change it. The desire to maintain its core aspects 
    should guide this change."

Examples of the need to change certain aspects of the human experience, which do not uniquely damage it:

 - We see beauty in nature - in any natural world - not just earth. Becoming multiplanetary would not sacrifice the human experience.
 - We learn to accept uncertainty so as to handle our inability to know everything. Though naturally we strive against this ambiguity. The pursuit of knowledge and truth does not conflict nature of ambiguity, so long as we recognize the our inability to know everything.

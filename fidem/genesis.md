DEFINING THE GENESIS FOR DAWN
-----------------------------

Roles of dawn:
  1. Record and aggregate real data about your life
    1. why: make evidence-based decisions (no more speculation)
  2. Enforce and understand your ethos
    1. why: make decisions on what is the most important thing to do right now
  3. Invest time aggresively (have perspective on long term goals)
    1. build and overall better experience and progress on goals
  4. Understand the concept of time
    1. why: projects, goals and scheduling all happen in this dimension
  5. Manage knowledge and continued learning (esp. reading)
    1. why: learning is incredibly important
  6. Understand and react to the concept of free time (resistant to sub-optimal execution)
    1. why: dawn will not manage everything, checking out for a weeking, or a night needs to be ok
  7. Succesfully deal with outside constants (work, for example, 9-5 block of time)
    1. why: dawn cannot and should not expect to manage this time
  8. Manage memory learning (understand and apply memory algorithms, esp. quotations)
    1. why: memorization is the basis of all knowledge
  9. Manage memory queue
    1. why: fluid memory is limited, cache everything for later

(o) Dawn is composed of several smaller parts
  - keep your tools small and sharp
  - there should be composable pieces that together form a whole

So then, the problem:

Knowing what to do, and for the most part how to do it.
Not having the mental bandwidth to both manage doing and execute doing
Dawn manages doing

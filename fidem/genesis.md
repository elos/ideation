Defining the Genesis for Elos
-----------------------------

##### Roles
  1. Record and aggregate real data about your life
    1. why: make evidence-based decisions (no more speculation)
  2. Enforce and understand your ethos
    1. why: make decisions on what is the most important thing to do right now
  3. Invest time aggresively (have perspective on long term goals)
    1. why: better overall experience and progress on goals
  4. Understand the concept of time
    1. why: projects, goals and scheduling all happen in this dimension
  5. Manage knowledge and continued learning (esp. reading)
    1. why: learning is incredibly important
  6. Understand and react to the concept of free time (resistant to sub-optimal execution)
    1. why: elos will not manage everything, checking out for a weekend, or a night needs to be ok
  7. Succesfully deal with outside constants (work, for example, 9-5 block of time)
    1. why: elos cannot and should not expect to manage this time
  8. Manage memory learning (understand and apply memory algorithms, esp. quotations)
    1. why: memorization is the basis of all knowledge
  9. Manage memory queue
    1. why: fluid memory is limited, cache everything for later

Elos is composed of several composite parts, each of which is small and sharp and specific.

##### Crux

We know what to do, and, mostly, how to do it.

We do not have the mental bandwidth to manage and plan our course of action while we carry it out.

Elos manages action.

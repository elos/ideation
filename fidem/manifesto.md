Manifesto Elos
--------------

The human species is primarily characterized by three aspects: a will to survive, a will to be around others, and a will for progress and posterity.

These compounding motivations result in a human experience characterized by love and trust and faith, by generosity and struggle and hope, by tragedy and beauty.

In setting about to improve the human experience and ensure the continuation of humanity, one must take care to preserve that which defines the human experience.  To improve the human condition is to change it. The desire to maintain its core aspects should guide this change.

Examples of the need to change certain aspects of the human experience, which do not uniquely damage it:
 * We see beauty in nature - in any natural world - not just earth. Becoming multiplanetary would not sacrifice the human experience.
 * We learn to accept uncertainty so as to handle our inability to know everything. Though naturally we strive against this ambiguity. The pursuit of knowledge and truth does not conflict nature of ambiguity, so long as we recognize the our inability to know everything.

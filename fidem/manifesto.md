Manifesto Elos
--------------

The human species is primarily characterized by three aspects: a will to survive, a will to be around others, and a will for progress and posterity.

These compounding motivations result in a human experience characterized by love and trust and faith, by generosity and struggle and hope, by tragedy and beauty.

In setting about to improve the human experience and to ensure the continuation of humanity, one must take care to preserve that which defines the human experience.  To improve the human condition is to change it. The desire to maintain its core aspects should guide this change.

Elos is math and logic applied through a filter of philosphy on what you think is important and what you believe can be improved. Elos fights for the parts of your day that make you who you are and allots time for the parts that make you who you want to be.

Manifesto Elos
--------------

The human species is primarily characterized by three aspects: a will to survive, a will to be around others, and a will for progress and posterity.

These result in a human experience charecterized by love and trust and faith, by generosity and struggle and hope, by tragedy and beauty.

Setting about to improve the human experience and the continued survival of humanity, one must take care to preserve that which defines the human experience.  To improve the human condition is to change it, and maintaining its core aspects should serve as guidance for this change.

Some examples of the need to change certain aspects of the human experience, which do not uniquely damage it.
 * We see beauty in nature - in any physical world - not just earth. We can become multiplanetary without losing the human experience.
 * We learn to accept uncertainty and ambiguity so as to handle our inability to know everything. Though the pursuit of knowledge in understanding conflicts not with the nature of ambiguity because we recognize the inability to know everything.

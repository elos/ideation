Manifesto Elos
--------------

The human species is primarily characterized by three aspects: a will to survive, a will to be around others, and a will for progress and posterity.

These compounding motivations result in a human experience characterized by love and trust and faith, by generosity and struggle and hope, by tragedy and beauty.

In setting about to improve the human experience and to ensure the continuation of humanity, one must take care to preserve that which defines the human experience.  To improve the human condition is to change it. The desire to maintain its core aspects should guide this change.

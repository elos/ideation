Elos Mission
------------

 - We take care of others, by helping them take care of themselves.
 - We build a better experience for others, by focusing on how they feel.
 - We propel community forward, by establishing shared values.

Progress, far from consisting in change, depends on retentiveness. You mus tknow and understand the past in order to plan for the future.

Elos Level 2: Concepts

(Freeze can help guide the organization of this, but this is just flowing as I’m thinking right now.)

 - The question is, what does elos ultimately actually do?
   - There are four answers, which as we will see, combine to achieve the goal Freeze laid out in the philosophy:
   - Elos is making a decision of what to do over a set of alternative actions
   - Elos is recording and aggregating the data about your life
   - Elos is a repository of best practices for lifestyle
   - Elos is a philosophy for how to live
 - So we developed a philosophy for how to live. Which we translate into our notion of the best practices. Indeed, in order to improve systematically we must have some measurement of that success: elos collects data. And ultimately elos uses the processing power and well-defined algorithms to decide and suggest what to do.

Elos is math and logic applied through a filter of philosophy on what you think is important and what you believe can be improved. What we at elos can be improved across all of us.

“Elos fights for the parts of your day that make you who you are and allots time for the parts that make you who you want to be” - Royce Branning

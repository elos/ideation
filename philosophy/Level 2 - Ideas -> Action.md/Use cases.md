we should model our entire process on the survival of the fittest/lean manufacturing movement ideologies.  Assume everything is broken even if it’s working (because it can always be improved)

 - Initial phase of development (most readily buildable)
   - focus is data, we need to gather enough info to be able to build the product we eventually want while also focusing on developing the ideology and search/sort algorithms so that this data is optimally accessible. everything should be highly customizable at this point (the way a user customizes info is data)
     - **USE CASES:**
       - life organization:
         - calendar
         - reminders
         - prioritization help/guidance (more difficult)
           - The User puts in their interests and we help them find joy.
             - I like music, I have this much money "go to this concert then"
             - connect them with other elosers that have similar interests, not overtly but in a subtle way somehow.
 - Middle phase
   - focus is the transition.  We want to ease into the more scary/exciting ideas of the product (which would be: mind reading/mind influencing [influencing is still up for debate, turning people into robots is the opposite of what we want to do hence the word “influencing.” it should be a subconscious suggestion rather than a command, just a way to convey information without distracting someones attention or focus completely])
     - **USE CASES:**

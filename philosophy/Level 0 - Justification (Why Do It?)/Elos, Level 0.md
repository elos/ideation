We, the human race, have changed the world
Many of the the concerns which were once extremely important (predators, shelter from the elements, the threat of opposing factions/tribes of humans) are no longer problems
Many of things which were once rare luxuries are now readily accessible (sugary food, entertainment, sex)



    This physical change to the world around us has caused a rift between the mind and the information it is calibrated to process.  (due to its relatively rapid unfolding relative to the history of time?) yes
    Our subconscious priorities are out of alignment with our conscious priorities.
    I may consciously desire to lose weight, but when I see a doughnut my subconscious will tell me to eat it because subconsciously I desire the sugar/fat
    this misalignment is bad ?
    it is possible that the conflict between the conscious and the subconscious is what makes us human, if we were purely subconscious or conscious then we would be animals
    ^^^ I don’t know, that might be a component of the ability to compare and reason. Like the fact that we can reflect allows us to reflect on the things we do innately but I’m not sure...is that an essential conflict? maybe. Maybe that’s why we see sex all over TV these days, a lot of the songs on the radio are about sex, and awful food which decimates your health is consumed more often that vegetables.
    What I meant is that if we were both automatically aware of what is right and also automatically did that thing, we would be ***automatons*** The vagueness of the world around us allows room for choice and "humanity."  I'm not sure eliminating that vagueness, or even reducing it would be a good thing.

    As I understand, the goal of Elos is to increase harmony in the human life by aligning the subconscious with the modern conscious.  You say what your priorities are and we will provide the calculations/processing power needed to work these priorities into the mundane vagary of everyday life, thereby making your goals more achievable. << can expand on “modern consciousness”??
    If I say that I prioritize losing weight, elos will take my physical data and the data available about the world around me, then optimize the best path to this goal.  This is what our subconscious tries to do, but it’s algorithm is outdated.



    The goal is NOT to replace or re-engineer the human subconscious.
    In a perfect world with perfect information we might do this, but we do not have the capability or level of certainty to risk the level of damage actually changing the subconscious physically could cause.

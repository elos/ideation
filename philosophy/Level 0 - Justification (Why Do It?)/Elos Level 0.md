Elos Level 0, Justification to Suffice for All Justification
Why can we form an opinion on a way of life?

When Aristotle wrote about the “good life,” he talked about the correct way to live. He defined the pursuit of happiness as the one true pursuit of all man. He defined explicitly the path in this goal and left little to interpretation. More than a thousand years later Kant rose to prominence appealing to a similar goal: there is indeed a correct way of life. Kant declared that pure reason alone formed the foundational aspect of such a life, and that anybody with the ability to reason would deduce the exact same conclusions as he. Kant broke slightly from such an explicit definition, indeed using reason more indirectly, but his goals were still prescriptive. As I understand it, Rawls wrote also of ethics, and in attempt to form some foundation on which to base his philosophy defined notions, such as “fairness,” axiomatically. I remember Rawls especially for his nature of championing mankind, for he believed that if you stripped the veil of prejudice and pretension from all men they would come to an amicable means. Rawls more defined an interface for personhood. There is a indeed a proper way to live, and it is marked by community and fairness.

I think the timing of these three notions is irrelevant. There likely were people thinking, if not saying, what Rawls said in the 20th century who were contemporaries with Aristotle. If anything, the timing of these three philosophers in a linear fashion says more about their time than their ideas. But I find the progression enlightening. All three appeal to the notion that there is a proper way to live? So first we must answer to that. But then all three go about philosophising in different ways. Aristotle: this is the correct way bar none. Kant: this is the correct way assuming reason. Rawls: this is more of what the correct way looks like. And Rawls I find the most powerful, because of it’s flexibility. I likewise see constitution as defining a sort of interface of government. But at elos we will go behind, can we suggest a “good” vs. a “bad” way of living. We will suggest such a life. Like Rawls we will define the interface. But then, like Aristotle, we will provide one implementation. That implementation is, of course, the elos system. First though, do good and bad exist? As an introduction to that discussion, we will use a proof by cases. We will show that the first case, though seemingly reaching a seemingly defeatist conclusion, provides all the flexibility of the second case, rendering it an entirely impotent conclusion and irrelevant. We shall see:

Do Good and Bad exist? is yes or no a false dichotomy? if so, does occam’s razor get us out of it? i.e., maybe things aren’t all good or all bad, they depend but then that’s 10x more complex so therefore all good or all bad.
Response to false dichotomy question
If no:
Then we are dust in the wind, it doesn’t matter what we do, we are already in harmony.  We can seek what we perceive to be good, but this perception is an illusion.  It is not bad that we are deluded.
This is nihilism.  It does not matter if this argument is correct as nothing follows from it.  If all actions are equal in value/goodness/potency, than we are free to chase whatever delusions we want.
If yes:
Then we should seek good, regardless of whether or not seeking it will actually increasing our chances of finding it (see 1.a.i.1)
    The first step in seeking good is defining it, we cannot search for something if we are not able to identify it when we find it
    So what is “Good”?
    Happiness?
    Then the ideal state of the universe is infinitely accelerating ecstasy.
    Although this sounds enjoyable, the experience is essentially one dimensional.  We sacrifice knowledge for breadth of experience.  It is also unlikely that this is possible.
    Perhaps what makes us human is the ability to compare and consider. Similarly to how you could not have good without some idea of bad, you can not have happiness without some idea of suffering. I claim it is in fact the suffering which provides fullness to the happiness. Freeze gets at this implicitly, I know “accelerating ecstasy” but just wanted to enunciate more.
    Tranquility
    We are
    How?
    By trusting our internal moral compass.  If we are essentially deluded this compass will be wrong, but in that scenario we are already lost anyways. we’ve lost? is there no recovery? what are the implications?  It is better to fail through action than inaction:
    failing through action means you were either deluded or incapable.  Both of those are symptoms which cannot be fought as long as you gave the maximum level of effort/focus.  no course was left unexplored
    failing through inaction means that you could have succeeded but did not allow yourself to.  You may have known the solution but because of some mental impediment did not attempt to solve the problem.


    So we assume that good exists, and is worth chasing:
    Define an interface for good?
